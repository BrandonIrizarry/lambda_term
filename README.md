# Lambda Term

This project is heavily under construction, and far from complete.

## Plans
 - Set up `requirements.txt`
 - CI

## Features

So far the language can implement simple arithmetic, e.g. the expression

```
(add one two)
```

evaluates to a lambda term equivalent to the numeral for three.

# Requirements

Python 3.13.
